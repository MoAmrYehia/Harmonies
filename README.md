# PyTorch 2020 Summer Hackathon

The PyTorch Summer Hackathon is back this year with all new opportunities for the connection with the PyTorch community to build innovative, impactful models, applications and other projects that create positive impact for organizations or people. My team has Created Harmonies with web interfaces powered by PyTorch.  

## Harmonies

Harmonies is an online photo editor that aims to simplify the process of editing photos. Now, you can use the same advanced tools from photoshop by drag and drop easily. We take advantage of the capabilities of computer vision to help our users with edit photos in an appropriate way. Our web application is powerd by three different Computer Vision (CV) models. 

### Model 1 (Auto Colorization)
Generally, it will take you around 30 minutes to colorize (add color to) a black and white photo, but as you use Harmonies. You will bring new life to old photos by automatically colorizing them using the capabilities of Computer Vision!

### Model 2 (Auto Cropping)
The pen tool is the most powerful tool in Illustrator and Photoshop. It allows you to define your own anchor points to extract elements from your image. Now you don't need all of this hard work, with Harmonies you can easily extract your image from the background and add it to another photo!

### Model 1 (Adding Harmonies)
Copying an element from a photo and pasting it into a painting is a challenging task. Applying photo compositing techniques in this context yields subpar results that look like a collage. We introduce a technique to adjust the parameters of the transfer depending on the painting. For adding Harmonies to the painting and give a sense of uniqueness!.
